# Side Hustle

# Description
The web application that connects potential customers with the people that are willing to sell their service.
Services, escpecially tutoring, are usually advertised on pin-walls and street poles by people who have the potential of making more money.
The change that their advertisement is seen is based on the number of people that pass by the advertisement, and not most of them need the service.
Side Hustle could be the break through for this problem by centralizing these parties on a single platform, where talents could make themselves a profile and the custoers could just look up the service name on the search bar.
