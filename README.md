# Side Hustle

## Description
The web application that connects potential customers with the people that are willing to sell their service.\
Services, escpecially tutoring, are usually advertised on pin-walls and street poles by people who have the potential of making more money.\
The change that their advertisement is seen is based on the number of people that pass by the advertisement, and not most of them need the service.\
Side Hustle could be the break through for this problem by centralizing these parties on a single platform, where talents could make themselves a profile and the custoers could just look up the service name on the search bar.

## User
All users, whether suppliers or customers, **should have a profile** made for themselves.\
The profile being made must include **contact info** (mandatory: email, optional: social media fields listed) and an **address**, as it is necessary to enable both parties to get in touch and to meet up if applicable.\
The email is going to be registered once the user has signed up and the address is going to be prompted when creating or editing the user's own profile in the **dashboard**.\
For customers to be able to search up talents, click the **search** tab and type-in the talent in the search bar.\
For supploers, each field in the profile creation is crucial to give customers the details you want them to know, and follow the prompt details for each field.\ \

Each customer that has been served can rate their supplier after he/she has given the service.

## Developer
To briefly introduce, this web application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, in the manner where the client file (the React App) is inside the root. So the root of the project contains the React App, the server.js (equivalent to index.js), and the back-end routes.
